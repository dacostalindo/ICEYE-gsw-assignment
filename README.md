## Task 1 - LARVIS will not mess with my coffee

In this repository, the task 1 folder is split between the return_coins function and its corresponding test cases.

The return_coins function outputs a dictionary with the amount of coins for each segment (2€, 1€, 0.5€, 0.2€, 0.1€, 0.05€, 0.02€, and 0.01€). While the test cases verify the sum of the coins is equal to the given change.
